# vanilla-node-todo-app

This project is a simple full stack TODO list app, the front end is written in React, the backend is written in vanilla Node with no frameworks, and the database is implemented using Mysql. 

I created this project to help me learn node, this is the reason I chose to use vanilla node and not a framework like express, implementing the backend using only node helps my understanding of what frameworks may be doing under the hood. 

This is by no means the best way to implement a backend API in node but if you wish to recreate this project then create the database by using the SQL in the database directory. To run the server, inside the server directory install the dependencies with npm install then start the server with node server.js. 
Ensure the database is running before attempting to start the server or it will fail to start.
To run the client, inside the client directory install the dependencies with npm install then start the client with npm start.
